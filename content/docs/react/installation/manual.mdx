## Installation Guide

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Setting Up Your Next.js Project

    Please refer to the official [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation) when creating a new project.
    When setting it up, make sure to enable **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, as MijnUI depends on both.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Install Dependencies

    Install the required packages:

    ```package-install
      @mijn-ui/react-core tw-animate-css tailwind-variants tailwind-merge
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
     ### Tailwind CSS Configuration

    Configure Tailwind CSS by updating your `globals.css` file:

    ```css title="globals.css"
    @import "tailwindcss";
    @import "tw-animate-css";
    @import "@mijn-ui/react-core/theme.css";
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  
  ### That's it

    You can now start adding components to your project. Check out the [components](/docs/components/accordion) section to learn more about the available components.
